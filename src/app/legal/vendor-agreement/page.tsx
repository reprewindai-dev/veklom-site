          </p>
          <p>
            This Vendor Services Agreement (&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) governs the
            provision of services, software, deliverables, support, consulting,
            infrastructure, development, security, compliance, or other vendor
            services provided to Veklom Inc. (&ldquo;Veklom&rdquo;) by the
            vendor, contractor, supplier, consultant, service provider, or other
            counterparty accepting this Agreement (&ldquo;Vendor&rdquo;).
          </p>
          <p>
            This Agreement is designed to protect Veklom&rsquo;s self-hosted,
            sovereign AI control-plane business model. Veklom&rsquo;s customer
            promise depends on strict control over source code, credentials,
            infrastructure access, security controls, regulated-data handling,
            audit artifacts, and intellectual property. Vendor must not access,
            process, store, transmit, disclose, or retain Veklom Confidential
            Information or Customer Data except as expressly authorized in
            writing by Veklom.
          </p>
          <p>
            By providing services to Veklom, accessing Veklom systems, accepting
            a purchase order, signing an order form or statement of work, or
            otherwise performing work for Veklom, Vendor agrees to be bound by
            this Agreement.

      <p>
        This Agreement applies to all services, deliverables, software,

        (&ldquo;SOW&rdquo;). Each SOW is incorporated into this Agreement. If
        there is a conflict between this Agreement and an SOW, this Agreement
        controls unless the SOW expressly states that it amends a specific

      <h3 id="section-1-3">1.3 No Implied Authorization</h3>

        Vendor may perform only the work expressly authorized by Veklom. Access
        to a system, repository, credential, dataset, customer environment,
        workspace, or communication channel does not authorize Vendor to use,
        copy, export, retain, transmit, disclose, or access information beyond
        what is necessary to perform the approved work.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-2">2. Vendor Responsibilities</h2>

      <h3 id="section-2-1">2.1 Standard of Performance</h3>
      <p>
        Vendor will perform all services in a professional, competent, secure,
        and workmanlike manner using personnel with appropriate skill, training,
        and experience. Vendor will comply with Veklom&rsquo;s reasonable
        instructions, security requirements, repository policies, development
        standards, and documentation requirements.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-2-2">2.2 No Customer-Facing Commitments</h3>
      <p>
        Vendor may not make commitments, warranties, representations, pricing
        statements, roadmap promises, service-level commitments, compliance
        statements, or legal statements to any Veklom customer, prospect,
        regulator, auditor, or partner unless expressly authorized in writing by
        Veklom.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-2-3">2.3 No Production Changes Without Approval</h3>

        without prior written approval from Veklom.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-2-4">2.4 Documentation</h3>
      <p>
        Vendor will document material work performed for Veklom, including code

        </li>
        <li>
          Protect Veklom Confidential Information using at least reasonable care

          information;
        </li>
        <li>
          Restrict access to personnel with a need to know and who are bound by

        </li>
        <li>
          Not disclose Veklom Confidential Information to any third party
          without Veklom&rsquo;s prior written consent;
        </li>

      <p>
        Vendor may not use Veklom&rsquo;s name, logo, trademarks, customer
        names, screenshots, architecture diagrams, source code, product
        references, or relationship with Veklom in marketing, case studies,

        statements without prior written approval from Veklom.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-3-4">3.4 Compelled Disclosure</h3>
      <p>
        If Vendor is legally required to disclose Veklom Confidential
        Information, Vendor will, to the extent legally permitted, provide
        prompt written notice to Veklom and reasonably cooperate with
        Veklom&rsquo;s efforts to seek confidential treatment or limit
        disclosure.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-4">4. Data Protection and Customer Data</h2>

      <p>
        Vendor is not authorized to access, process, store, transmit, export,
        retain, or view Customer Data unless Veklom expressly authorizes such

        prompts, model outputs, logs, audit artifacts, customer configuration,
        regulated data, PHI, personal information, API keys, secrets, and

      <h3 id="section-4-2">4.2 Data Processing Addendum</h3>
      <p>
        If Vendor processes personal information, personal data, PHI, customer

        protection agreement approved by Veklom before processing begins.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-4-3">4.3 HIPAA and BAA Requirement</h3>
      <p>
        Vendor may not access, process, store, transmit, or receive PHI unless
        Veklom has approved such access in writing and the parties have executed
        a Business Associate Agreement where required by HIPAA. Vendor must not
        use consumer AI tools, external SaaS tools, unmanaged storage, personal
        devices, or unapproved subprocessors for PHI or regulated data.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-4-4">4.4 Data Minimization</h3>
      <p>
        Vendor will access only the minimum information necessary to perform

        credential rotation, device wipe, and confirmation of deletion.

        Product&rdquo; and are owned exclusively by Veklom.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-7-2">7.2 Assignment</h3>

        display, make, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise exploit those
        materials as part of or in connection with Veklom products and services.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-7-5">7.5 No Encumbrances</h3>
      <p>
        Vendor represents that Work Product will not be subject to liens,

        libraries, APIs, SDKs, or other third-party materials in Work Product
        unless approved by Veklom or already permitted by Veklom&rsquo;s

      </p>

      <h3 id="section-8-2">8.2 Prohibited Materials</h3>

        Vendor may not introduce materials that require disclosure of Veklom
        source code, impose copyleft obligations on proprietary Veklom code,
        restrict commercial use, create data-sharing obligations, require
        attribution not approved by Veklom, or conflict with Veklom&rsquo;s

      </p>

      <h3 id="section-9-2">9.2 Vendor Responsibility</h3>
      <p>
        Vendor remains fully responsible for all acts and omissions of approved
        subcontractors. Vendor must ensure approved subcontractors are bound by
